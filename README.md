# Rat16S Compiler
**CPSC 323 - Compilers and Languages**\
**Projects 1, 2 and 3**

### **Problem description:**
Develop the parts of a compiler capable of processing and verifying a high level programming language into a low level machine independant language (intermediate code).

### **Goals:**
1) Understand lexical analysis (tokenization)
2) Understand syntax analysis (code structure and grammer)
3) Understand intermediate code generation (assembly)
4) Practice with finite state machines

### **How it works:**
This program is compiler for the Rat16S programming language. It takes a Rat16s text file and performs three steps (lexical analysis, syntax analysis and intermediate code generation) to produce intermediate assembly code. Each stage produces one or more files to be taken as input for the next stage.
